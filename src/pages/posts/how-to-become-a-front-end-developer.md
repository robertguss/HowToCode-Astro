## Text Editor

A text editor is a tool that developers use to write code. It is the most critical tool in your arsenal. So, before we can begin learning how to write code, we need to learn the basics of this tool. As you progress into the next sections, you are going to be using your text editor a lot and will gain the most knowledge and experience as you are learning how to code.

In this section, I want you first to download [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and get familiar with the basics.

## HTML

In this section, you are going to learn HTML. HTML is the backbone of the web. It is the studs inside of a house or the bones in our bodies. It is the foundation upon which all web pages are built. So, having a solid grasp of it is crucial.

[**Learn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe**](http://learn.shayhowe.com/)

> Start with the left column first and then move on to the right column advanced section. In the left sidebar there is also a Course 201 'Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS' you should take this course as well.

## CSS

You have already learned a lot about CSS in Shay Howe's course, but I am going to suggest some additional courses/resources for learning flexbox.

[**What The Flexbox?!**](https://flexbox.io/)

**[Flexbox Zombies](https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies)**

## JavaScript

JavaScript is the single most important language you need to know as a Front-End developer. I **strongly** advise you to take them in the order listed below.

1. [**Practical JavaScript**](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript)
2. [**Eloquent JavaScript**](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
3. [**JavaScript 30**](https://javascript30.com/)
4. [**You Don't Know JS**](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md)

## Helpful Resources:

- [**MDN JavaScript Documentation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [**Github Education Pack**](https://education.github.com/pack) - for students only! it includes a bunch of excellent free resources and tools and also a 6-month subscription to [**Frontend Masters**](https://frontendmasters.com/).

## Web Design

These resources are in no particular order, but I think are helpful. You don't need to master design, as that is a designer's job. You should however be familiar with the basics. This section is not mandatory, but you might want to check out the resources I have below and 'dip your toes in the water.'
